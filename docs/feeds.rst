Feeds
=====

Puput allows to customize the feeds for your blog entries. These options can be found in the settings tab while editing blog properties.


Feed description
----------------
Set *Use short description in feeds* to False if you want to use the full blog post content as description for the feed items.
When set to True (by default), Puput will try to use the blog post's excerpt or truncate the body to 70 words when the excerpt is not available.
